This project is motivated by Kaggle LLM - Detect AI Generated Text. <br>
The folders contain three notebooks coverring the three stages: EDA, Model training, and Validation & Demo.<br>
Demo can be accessed through "https://huggingface.co/spaces/kaitehtzeng/primary_app".<br>
Notice that the free version of harddrive does not support GPU. <br>
Thus, it may take 20 secs to generate the result.<br>
Also, the model is trained with essays written by students and those written by AI. <br>
As a result, the model is not designed for adult-written essay. <br>
